# Building Examples #

Under OPS\_DIR/Examples, you will find example IDL's in the directory OPSIdls.
One of these examples is called **TestAll**. A corresponding C++ implementation
is called **TestAllC++Test**.

Open **TestAllC++Test.sln** under **TestAllC++Test** and build and run it to
see that your OPS installation works correctly for C++.
Check the boost reference to the include and library directories so they point
to your boost installation to make the sample compile alright.
